# Trade Entry Template

This directory contains the template file used for trade entries.

## Files

- **trade-template.md** - Template for new trade entries with YAML frontmatter and markdown structure

## Usage

This template is used as a reference for the structure of trade entries. New trades are created following this format with the naming convention: `MM:DD:YYYY.N.md` where N is the trade number for that day.

## Note

The template filename was changed from `**:**:****.*.md` to `trade-template.md` to avoid Jekyll build failures caused by special characters (colons and asterisks) being interpreted as URL schemes.
