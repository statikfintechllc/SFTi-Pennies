## Notes

The trade was an unsuccessful attempt to execute the Step #5 Dip Buy. The stock had previously peaked above $4.20 and was in a strong Cliff Dive Step #4. The entry at $3.43, 05:24:07, was below the session VWAP of $3.77, identifying the correct area of value for a bounce attempt. However, the anticipated buying pressure failed to appear, and the price continued to bleed lower. The trader correctly utilized the stop-limit order, exiting at $3.17, 06:17:23, for a controlled loss of -$4.98. This outcome, while a loss, is a successful display of risk management, as it prevented a small loss from escalating into a larger one as the stock continued to decline toward $2.87.
