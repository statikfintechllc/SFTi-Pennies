## How to Deploy and Use

### Step 1: Deploy to a Public HTTPS Server

You need to host your app on a public HTTPS server. Options:

**Option A: Vercel (Recommended - Free)**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

**Option B: Netlify (Free)**
1. Drag and drop the `dist` folder to netlify.com
2. Your app will get a public HTTPS URL

**Option C: GitHub Pages**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Pages with the `dist` folder

### Step 2: Install on Your iPhone

1. **Open Safari** on your iPhone
2. **Navigate** to your deployed app URL
3. **Tap the Share button** (square with arrow)
4. **Select "Add to Home Screen"**
5. **Name it** "SFTi Scanner" and tap "Add"

### Step 3: First Time Setup

1. **Open the app** from your home screen
2. **Tap the Settings gear** in the top right
3. **Tap "Login to IBKR"**
