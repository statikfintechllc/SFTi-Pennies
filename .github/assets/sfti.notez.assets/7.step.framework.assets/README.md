## üìä Framework Phase Images

### Step #1: Pre-Pump or Promotion
**File:** `Step.1.png`

**Example:** ALYI (Alternet Systems Inc.) - YTD October 6, 2021

**What to Look For:**
- Flat, low-volume trading
- Stock trading near historic lows
- Accumulation before major move
- Patience required - can take weeks or months
- Best for small accounts willing to wait

**Trading Approach:** Early entry with high risk/reward, requires predicting the spike before it happens.

---

### Step #2: Ramp
**File:** `Step.2.png`

**Example:** ENZC (Enzolytics Inc.) - YTD October 6, 2021

**What to Look For:**
- Initial price increase with volume spike
- Breaking above recent resistance levels
- First signs of momentum building
- Volume increasing but not parabolic yet
- Pattern forming the base for breakout

**Trading Approach:** Early breakout traders enter here, catching the initial momentum before the supernova.

---

### Step #3: Supernova
**File:** `Step.3.png`

**Example:** HQGE (HQ Global Education Inc.) - YTD October 6, 2021

**What to Look For:**
- Parabolic price movement
- Massive volume surge
- Multiple green days in a row
- Breaking through multiple resistance levels
- Peak euphoria and FOMO

**Trading Approach:** Most rewarding but riskiest phase. Buy breakouts but be cautious of overextension. Always follow Rule #1: Cut losses quickly.

**Warning:** The higher it goes, the more overextended it becomes.

---

### Step #4: Cliff Dive
**File:** `Step.4.png`

**Example:** CYBL (Cyberlux Corp.) - YTD October 6, 2021

**What to Look For:**
- Sharp reversal from highs
- Heavy red candles with volume
- Breaking below support levels
- Panic selling begins
- "What goes up must come down"

**Trading Approach:** Formerly prime shorting territory. High risk due to unpredictable bounces. Wait for confirmation of trend reversal.

---

### Step #5: Dead Cat Bounce
**File:** `Step.5.png`

**What to Look For:**
- First bounce after cliff dive
- Lower volume than supernova
- Usually fails at previous support (now resistance)
- Short-lived recovery attempt
- "Bouncing knife" - dangerous to catch

**Trading Approach:** Can be traded by experienced traders looking for quick scalps. Requires precision timing and strict stops.

---

### Step #6: Secondary Bounces
**File:** `Step.6.png`

**What to Look For:**
- Multiple smaller bounces after initial crash
- Each bounce typically weaker than the last
- Decreasing volume with each attempt
- Trading range establishment
- False hope for recovery

**Trading Approach:** More predictable shorting opportunities. Less range but easier to find shares. Risk of multi-spike patterns exists.

---

### Step #7: Long Kiss Goodnight
**File:** `Step.7.png`

**Example:** SHMP (NaturalShrimp Inc.) - 3-year chart

**What to Look For:**
- Gradual decline over weeks/months
- Diminishing volume
- Lower lows, lower highs
- Bounces getting smaller like a ball losing momentum
- Return to pre-pump levels or lower

**Trading Approach:** Not tradeable for most. Avoid "catching falling knives." Wait for new patterns to emerge.

**Reality Check:** Penny stock pumps don't end with the company succeeding. They're typically temporary hype cycles.
